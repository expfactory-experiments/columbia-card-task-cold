Each card is either a gain card or a loss card (there are no neutral cards). You will know how many gain cards and loss cards are in the deck of 32, and how many points you will gain or lose if you turn over a gain or loss card. What you do not know is which of the 32 cards that you see face-down are gain cards and which are loss cards. </p>'+

You will not see the cards turned over, but the game will select a random set of cards equal to the number you chose and "turn them over" without you seeing. For each gain card turned over, points are added to your round total and another card is turned over. This continues until a loss card is uncovered or until the number of cards you chose to turn over is reached. The first time a loss card is turned over, the loss points will be subtracted from your current point total and the round is over – even if you indicated that more cards should be turned over.
